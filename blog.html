                 <h2>Learn JavaScript - in fun way!</h2>
                 <p class="text show-more">JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and 
                    lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.<span class="dots">.....</span> </span><span class="moreText">
                    JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language employed by most websites along with HTML and CSS to create robust, dynamic and 
                    interactive user experiences. The JavaScript programming language was introduced in 1995 and has since become one of the most popular 
                    with support by all major web browsers. JavaScript programs are used both client-side and server-side to add functionality to web pages.
                     A 2016 Stack Overflow developer survey listed JavaScript as the most popular front end developer and back end development technology.

                <h2>How JavaScript Makes Things Dynamic</h2>
                <p>HTML defines the structure of your web document and the content therein. CSS declares various styles for the contents provided
                     on the web document.HTML and CSS are often called markup languages rather than programming languages, because they, at their 
                     core, provide markups for documents with very little dynamism.</p>

                <h2>How to Use JavaScript in HTML?</h2>
                <p>Just like with CSS, JavaScript can be used in HTML in various ways, such as:<br>
                    <b>1. Inline JavaScript</b><br>
                          Here, you have the JavaScript code in HTML tags in some special JS-based attributes.<br>
                    <b>2. Internal JavaScript, with the script tag</b><br>
                          Just like the style tag for style declarations within an HTML page, the script tag exists for JavaScript.<br>
                    <b>3. External JavaScript</b><br>
                          You may want to have your JavaScript code in a different file. External JavaScript allows this.<br>

                <h2>Variables in JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Variables are containers for values of any data type. They hold values such that when the variables are used, JavaScript
                     uses the value they represent for that operation.</p>
